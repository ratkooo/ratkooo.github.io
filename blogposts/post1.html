        I chose studying ICT because I always enjoyed working with computers and
        programming seems like the best way to earn a good salary and to have a
        career built upon it. My first idea was to go study in Denmark, but they
        made it much more difficult for international students to actually apply
        and get accepted for a school, so my second best option was Netherlands,
        and I got this school recommended by a student agency Information
        Planet.

        I will probably want to expand my education by doing a Masters degree
        regarding ICT, I don't yet know what I would like to study, but I'm
        thinking about Game Design.

        I studied mechatronics at my secondary school, and I found out that
        machinery and automatization stuff doesn't really interest me and I
        don't want to do anything regarding that in my life.
