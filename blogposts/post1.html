    <p>I chose studying ICT because I always enjoyed working with computers and
        programming seems like the best way to earn a good salary and to have a
        career built upon it. My first idea was to go study in Denmark, but they 
        made it much more difficult for international students to actually apply
        and get accepted for a school, so my second best option was Netherlands, and 
        I got this school recommended by a student agency Information Planet.</p>
    <p>
        I will probably want to expand my education by doing a Masters degree
        regarding ICT, I don't yet know what I would like to study, but I'm
        thinking about Game Design.

    <p>I studied mechatronics at my secondary school, and I found out that machinery
        and automatization stuff doesn't really interest me and I don't want to do
        anything regarding that in my life.
