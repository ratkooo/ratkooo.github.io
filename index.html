    <h2>Why HBO-ICT</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I chose ICT because I always enjoyed working with computers and liked spending time behind a screen, and this degree seemed like the best choice for me personally. One of the 
        biggest motivation for me personally was the possibility of working from home, as I feel the most comfortable at home. The <a target="_blank"
        href="https://hz.nl/en/"
        class="link">HZ University of Applied Sciences</a> was my go-to ever since
        I first started looking for an university in Netherlands. So far I have felt motivated and able to do most of the things I was supposed to.</p>
        <p>My first experience with programming was
        back in secondary school and my best accomplishment in terms of programming was creating a working vending machine by using Arduino robots and C++ programming language. Using programming
        to make physical things move was always my favourite part of programming, but it might change during my study years on HZ.
