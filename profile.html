    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        My name is Radovan Vyšňan, I was born in Poprad, Slovakia where I have
        lived my whole life. I have always taken pride in myself and I'm happy
        to come from said country. Ever since I can remember, I was always
        fiddling with things and trying to improve / make things work. I started
        school when I was 6 and finished my education in Slovakia by attending
        the Secondary School of Technology and Design in Poprad. I passed my
        final exams with almost perfect grades, so it motivated me to try even
        harder at this University. I studied a 4 year course, my degree was
        mechatronics. The thing I'm most grateful for that school gave me is the
        basics of programming and the ability to work with electrical circuits
        and components. I hope my horizons will broaden during the time spent
        here on HZ University, so I can lay a good foundation for my future
        career.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I usually play video games or spend times with my
        friends. Back in Slovakia I also used to skate quite a bit, but I still
        haven't really got back into it ever since I moved here. My favourite
        games ever are Skyrim and Dark Souls franchise.
